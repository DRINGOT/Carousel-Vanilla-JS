* `<h1>` with animation.
* img in `<li>` with a border animate gradient.
* button with style hover.
<br>

* Functions:
    * On click of the button "next", we can pass at the next image
    * On click of the button "previous", we can pass at the previous image
> Those functions works with the switch of a class CSS named 'active' between `<li>`on click.
>all image are at the start in display without the 1st `<li>`.
>The class 'active' display block the `<li>` so img appear.
